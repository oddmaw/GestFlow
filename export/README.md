# Export Directory

This directory is intended to store exported files generated by the application.

## Structure

*   **`invoices/`:** This subdirectory will contain files generated from invoices.
*   **`commands/`:** This subdirectory will contain files generated from commands/orders.

## File Naming Convention

*   **Invoices:** `invoice_XXX.pdf`, where `XXX` is a numerical invoice identifier (e.g., `invoice_001.pdf`).
*   **Commands:** `command_XXX.csv`, where `XXX` is a numerical command/order identifier (e.g., `command_001.csv`).

## Usage

The application will save exported PDF and CSV files into this directory after users trigger an export action. These exported files can be used for archiving, printing, and other purposes.
